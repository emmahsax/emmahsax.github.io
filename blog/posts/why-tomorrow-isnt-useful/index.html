<p>I need to start of this blog post by clarifying: tomorrow is useful. When I&rsquo;m planning my week, it&rsquo;s quite useful to be able to say &ldquo;I need to go to the store tomorrow.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s pretty much necessary to acknowledge tomorrow when I&rsquo;m talking about making simple plans in the future, and what I intend to do. In this case, tomorrow is a tangible thing, after all, it&rsquo;s just a day of the week that&rsquo;s coming up in the future. However, what I&rsquo;m talking about is the conceptual idea of Tomorrow (with a capital T). And in this case, Tomorrow is not useful at all.</p>
<p>In short, the reason Tomorrow is not useful is because Tomorrow will never happen. Tomorrow is the short name for &ldquo;in the near, but not explicit, future.&rdquo; But what is literally and tangibly tomorrow at this very moment, will eventually become today, and what is conceptually Tomorrow, will never become Today.</p>
<p>I know the concept is a little bit confusing to explain, so I&rsquo;ll try to explain with an example. If today is Friday, then tomorrow is Saturday (woohoo, it&rsquo;s the weekend). But when tomorrow actually rolls around, then today is Saturday. And when we tell ourselves &ldquo;I need to go to the store tomorrow,&rdquo; we actually mean &ldquo;I need to go to the store on Saturday.&rdquo; And since, now, tomorrow is today, it means it&rsquo;s time to go to the store.</p>
<p>But how many times have we told ourselves we&rsquo;re going to do something Tomorrow, a.k.a., sometime in the future&hellip; maybe? I know I&rsquo;ve done it multiple times. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start that new diet Tomorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go to the gym Tomorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call my grandmother Tomorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just clean up the garage Tomorrow?&rdquo; We say these sentences when we don&rsquo;t really <em>want</em> to do whatever thing we&rsquo;re planning. We&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;ll do the task Tomorrow because we don&rsquo;t want to do it Today. We&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;ll do the task Tomorrow with the idea that Tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll be a better, more productive, kinder, healthier, etc, person.</p>
<p>But what I want to urge you (and myself) to consider is that instead of wanting to be that better person Tomorrow (in the near future), why don&rsquo;t we try to become that person <em>Today</em>? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start that diet Today.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go to the gym Today.&rdquo; If we keep telling ourselves we&rsquo;re going to do something Tomorrow&hellip; well, Tomorrow will never arrive. What we&rsquo;ve got—all we&rsquo;ve got—is Today. And tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll still only have Today.</p>
<p>So start those projects you&rsquo;ve been putting off Today. Start eating carrots instead of chips Today. Start a new exercise routine Today. All we have is Today, and that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re ever going to have. A person&rsquo;s life is simply made up of a lot of Todays strung together in a row. And the goals, good deeds, and tasks that we continue to put off until some time in the near, but not explicit, future will never actually happen <em>until</em> we decide that we&rsquo;re ready to start them Today.</p>
