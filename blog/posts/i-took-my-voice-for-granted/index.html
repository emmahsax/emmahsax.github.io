          </div>

          
          <div class="page-body"><p>When I write the phrase &ldquo;I took my voice for granted&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t mean my metaphorical voice, such as my right to free speech or anything like that (although I probably take that for granted as well). I mean my literal voice. My ability to phonate through my throat to make sounds, words, melodies, etc. For those that know me, or have looked through this website enough, it&rsquo;s clear that I&rsquo;ve always loved to use my voice. I&rsquo;ve been an amateur singer for ages, taking years of voice lessons. I did choir all throughout college. I&rsquo;ve done over 15 community theatre shows, most of which were musicals that involved lots of music rehearsals and singing. I&rsquo;ve given public presentations, and have always excelled in public speech. And those who are friends with me can attest that I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;talker&rdquo;. This means I <em>love</em> to talk, and am perfectly capable of and willing to dominate and lead conversations amongst small groups of friends.</p>
<p>So one of the worst things that could happen to me—losing my voice—started just a few months ago.</p>
<p>It started with a sore throat. To be honest, I&rsquo;ve had lots of sore throats throughout my life, so it didn&rsquo;t particularly concern me. But after a couple weeks, I realized my speaking voice felt raspy&hellip; and had been raspy for a while. My voice would tire quickly in meetings, and it sounded like I was consistently losing my voice. It&rsquo;d get tired, I&rsquo;d rest it for a few hours, and it would seem to get a little better&hellip; until the next day at least, when this would repeat again.</p>
<p>I realized my singing voice began to lose an octave (or maybe two) on the top register. I was no longer a proud soprano, but becoming a mezzo, or maybe even an alto. And, when I&rsquo;d try to hold out long notes, my voice would crack, which is something pretty new to me.</p>
<p>After about six weeks of these realizations, I decided to visit an ENT. I was very lucky, and managed to find an appointment within the week as long as I was willing to leave the house at 7am and drive an hour and a half to get there. I figured it was worth it. At the appointment, I (with too many words) updated the doctor and nurse of what I was experiencing. The doctor put a scope down my nose to take a look at my vocal folds. And there, the doctor saw the smallest bump on my right vocal cord.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to describe the feeling of loss and sadness that I felt when I saw the bump. And even to this day (two and a half months later), it fills my heart with pain to think about it. I tried to take so many precautions to keep my voice healthy, and yet&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t save my delicate vocal folds from damage. She told me that this likely is the cause of a specific event where I overused my voice, such as a sporting event with a lot of screaming. But when I looked back through my past calendar, all the way back to when my throat felt healthier&hellip; there was nothing specific. So, the real reason(s) as to why this has occurred remain a mystery, although my doctors have suspicions.</p>
<p>The ENT referred me to a vocal therapist who can perform a more detailed videostroboscopy of my throat. The video recording that the first scope obtained were of poor quality, so she didn&rsquo;t want to make assumptions about what she saw in the videos. After a couple weeks of making phone calls, leaving voicemails, and chasing down schedulers, I managed to make an appointment&hellip; for a month later. I was frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t get an earlier appointment, considering this very much felt like an emergency. But I did what I could, and I asked them to put me on the list for bumping up if an earlier time slot opened.</p>
<p>And a few days later, I got a phone call that the clinic had a cancellation. If I could get out the door in 10 minutes, I could get my videostroboscopy <em>today</em>! Props to my boss for being so flexible with me leaving work on such short notice. And the appointment only confirmed my worst nightmares. I had a polyp developing on one vocal cord, with a vocal nodule developing opposite it (most likely the nodule was the result of the polyp hitting the opposite vocal fold). I was prescribed heavy vocal rest (which turns out to be way more difficult than it should be), a few vocal theraputic exercises (that honestly feel like they&rsquo;re doing nothing), and few changes in lifestyle and diet to try to cut down on stress and acid reflux that could be negatively affecting my throat.</p>
<p>But the truth is that I have 20-some years-worth of talkative habits built up, and I historically have been a <strong><em>very loud</em></strong> talker. I don&rsquo;t think I even realized that people could still hear me when I talked quietly. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly why that is, but when I&rsquo;ve lived my whole life as a loud talker, well it&rsquo;s just the way I&rsquo;ve always been. And I <em>enjoy</em> talking and conversating with people&hellip; responding vocally to them in conversation is second-nature. And so, I found heavy vocal rest to be more difficult than it seems. And although I managed to work on cutting down stress and acid reflux, catching a cold and doing pretty constant coughing and throat clearing didn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>So when I went back to my next appointment several weeks later, I was dismayed, but not surprised, to find my throat hadn&rsquo;t gotten better&hellip; in fact, if anything, it almost got worse. My entire throat was red, swollen, and inflamed, and the polyp had grown bigger.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s next? Even more vocal rest. I try not to let myself talk for more than about 15 minutes consecutively, even in meetings. I make myself take words out of my sentences so I&rsquo;m saying less (and I&rsquo;m pretty wordy, so I really need to slow down to edit my sentences mid-thought). I track every day what I eat, and how I use my voice (such as speaking loudly, speaking in restaurants, bars, or sporting events, screaming, arguing, emotional talking—talking with high emotions causes a lot of throat tension, etc). And voice therapy. I have years of bad speaking habits and damaging singing patterns built up, and so the doctor has told me that I have to unlearn all of those habits and relearn how to speak, sing, grunt, and even laugh in healthier ways.</p>
<p>The doctors believe that I still have time to correct my voice&hellip; my vocal damage hasn&rsquo;t progressed to the point where it&rsquo;s unrecoverable, and I don&rsquo;t need surgery (yet). But at the same time, I don&rsquo;t know when it will get better&hellip; or even <em>if</em> it will get better. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be able to sing again, or when I&rsquo;ll be able to audition for a show again. When my whole life has been built around using my voice: talking, singing, and speaking loudly, it certainly feels like I need to rewire myself and become a different person (a &ldquo;non-talker&rdquo;) if I want any chance of being able to sing a soprano aria with ease ever again.</p>

<p>Below, I&rsquo;ve attached a few pictures from my videostroboscopies. I&rsquo;ve hidden them by default so my readers can choose whether to view them or not. Warning&hellip; they&rsquo;re of the inner human body, so they may be icky to some people.</p>
