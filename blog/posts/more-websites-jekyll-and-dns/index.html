          <div class="page-body"><p>Last week, for the first time in a couple of months, I felt the need to do more with my Jekyll website(s). GitHub Pages provides an opportunity to host as many sites as I wish, as long as their repository code is public and I&rsquo;m okay with the resulting site being public. I wasn&rsquo;t really okay with that situation, so instead, I opted to look at GitHub Pro. GitHub Pro offered to host my GitHub Pages site on repositories that were private, which was basically exactly what I wanted. I know that GitLab Pages could provide me with that same setup for free, but my whole world is on GitHub, and I didn&rsquo;t quite feel the need to switch that up yet.</p>
<p>When it comes to having a private website though, neither GitHub Pages nor GitLab Pages (free) offers that. So, I went to the handy-dandy Google for how to protect a GitHub Pages site. I ended up finding <a href="https://github.com/scottishstoater/protected-github-pages">@scottishstoater&rsquo; repo <em>protected-github-pages</em></a>.</p>
<p>As I started working on two new GitHub Pages sites I started to play around with the different Jekyll themes. It turns out that my original site (this one) was made so long ago that a decent amount about the themes have changed since then. Now, <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes">@pages-themes</a> manages most of the GitHub Pages themes (instead of the individual creators of the themes). They also do this thing where you can <code>@import {{ site.theme }};</code> into the CSS files, assuming that the theme is set in the <code>_config.yml</code>. What this means is that new users of the themes don&rsquo;t need to copy-paste all of the CSS files if they just want <em>exactly</em> the CSS settings of the original themes. This means that it&rsquo;s very possible that getting your GitHub Pages site up and running is fast&hellip; like super fast&hellip; like within-a-day-fast. In fact, both of my new GitHub Pages sites were running and live within a day.</p>
<p>What this also means is that, since none of the CSS is actually <em>in your repository</em>, when you want to make changes to the CSS (say edit the size of a button, change the font, etc), you need to go to the CSS source on GitHub, search in the entire repository for the piece that you need, and then copy-paste that entire element back to your repo and make the changes. To find exactly which piece of CSS required to make a change, I had to play a lot with using Chrome&rsquo;s Inspect option on my local site. Chrome&rsquo;s Inspect feature allowed me to find the exact value that I&rsquo;d need to edit so I copy-pasted the proper CSS element into my local repository 😕. I&rsquo;m sure that changing the themes&rsquo; CSS pattern had good intentions, but I actually found it quite annoying. Perhaps the <em>most</em> annoying part of this is that when running Jekyll locally, I got a petty warning about the <code>_includes/</code> directory not found in the source layout. Since I use the <code>_includes/</code> directory in every project, this was particularly irritating.</p>
<p>So instead, I went through each GitHub Pages repository I was using and copy-pasted <em>all</em> of the CSS code into my own directory, and then removed the setting of <code>theme</code> in the <code>_config.yml</code>. Now there&rsquo;s a ton of CSS lines in my repos, but I don&rsquo;t really mind, especially if all of the CSS can now be in one condensed file and repository, instead of calling a bunch of other files/repos.</p>
<p>I also took the weekend to standardize all of the code that sources my sites, so the directory and file layout of them all match. I even made another site that has nice buttons that links to each of my sites and their respective code. I also made that repo private and put in password protection. There&rsquo;s links to my other private site there, so I don&rsquo;t want people to figure out a way into the originally private site. So putting an extra password in for the new list of sites (that the world can&rsquo;t get to) is beneficial for me. (I should clarify that hackers could probably get in&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t put in top-notch security; even the example repos I used say that, but it&rsquo;s secure-enough 🤫).</p>
<p>The last thing I did this weekend was redo this site. I wanted to make the &ldquo;About Me&rdquo; and &ldquo;Interests &amp; Hobbies&rdquo; page more user-friendly. I wanted to rethink who my audience of this site is&hellip; besides me and my mom. I realized that I wanted it to be easier for prospective employers to see information about me. So reading about my favorite books and TV shows, while debatably interesting, maybe isn&rsquo;t the best content for my &ldquo;About Me&rdquo; page. Instead, that should be my resumé page. And then my &ldquo;Interests &amp; Hobbies&rdquo; page should look less bulletpoint-y and more section-y.</p>
<p>Oh&hellip; I also purchased my domain! 🙌🏼. I had been hesitant to make the commitment of which domain to buy for a while (which is silly because I commit for a year when I sign my apartment contract annually), but I finally took the plunge and purchased my domain: <code>emmasax4.info</code>. Technically, I could&rsquo;ve swapped out <code>.info</code> for <code>.com</code>, or <code>emmasax4</code> for just plain <code>emmasax</code>. But after a week of pondering what I wanted to choose, I realized that <code>4</code> is kind of my thing. My email has a 4. My Twitter has a 4. My GitHub has a 4. And of course, I did that all intentionally when I made those usernames (actually the email thing was just because <code>emma.sax@domain.com</code> was already taken, and the rest came <em>after</em> the email). So I figured that I might as well be intentional about my 4&rsquo;s and just make it happen with that! So in one night, I went through the work of setting up my DNS, hooking it all up into GitHub, and by the time I went to bed, I had my own websites hosted on GitHub Pages with custom domains and SSL.</p>
<p>Throughout my website &ldquo;spike,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to say that I learned a lot more about Jekyll. I learned more about how the Jekyll themes use CSS, I learned that a Jekyll theme is really just a bunch of CSS, and Jekyll itself is really just about the data structures and config files. I learned more about how the permalinks work. And I learned that Jekyll isn&rsquo;t really that magic 🎉&hellip; I could make my own Jekyll site by adding one file at a time, instead of selecting a specific theme in GitHub&rsquo;s Settings page. I learned more about DNS, and about hosting websites on custom domains. After all of this, I feel like I&rsquo;m finally ready to take on the website world!</p>

<p>EDIT: Since writing this blog post, I&rsquo;ve switched the primary domain for my website from <code>emmasax4.info</code> to <code>https://emmasax.com/</code>.
